## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── TaskInput.jsx     # Input form with validation
│   ├── TaskList.jsx      # Task container with mapping
│   ├── TaskItem.jsx      # Individual task with edit/delete
│   └── DebugPanel.jsx    # Development tools panel
├── App.jsx               # Main application logic
└── index.css            # Tailwind utilities
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Centralized state in App.jsx
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);

// Props drilling for clean data flow
<TaskInput onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
<TaskList tasks={tasks} onEditTask={handleEditTask} />
```

### Data Persistence Strategy
```javascript
// Load on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const savedTasks = localStorage.getItem('my-tasks');
  if (savedTasks) setTasks(JSON.parse(savedTasks));
}, []);

// Save on change (after initial load)
useEffect(() => {
  if (isLoaded) {
    localStorage.setItem('my-tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
  }
}, [tasks, isLoaded]);
```


## 🎯 Problem-Solving Approach

### Challenge 1: Data Persistence
**Problem**: Tasks disappearing on page refresh
**Solution**: Implemented localStorage with proper loading/saving cycle
```javascript
// Prevented premature overwrites with isLoaded flag
if (isLoaded) {
  localStorage.setItem('my-tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
}
```

### Challenge 2: User Experience
**Problem**: Confusing edit/delete interactions
**Solution**: Intuitive hover states and keyboard shortcuts
```javascript
// Keyboard shortcuts for editing
const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter') handleSave();
  if (e.key === 'Escape') handleCancel();
};
```

### Challenge 3: Developer Experience
**Problem**: Difficulty monitoring app state and testing features during development  
**Solution**: Implemented a dedicated debug panel with real-time stats, data export, and storage management tools.

```markdown
#### Debug Panel
- **📊 Real-time stats** – Instantly view task count and localStorage status
- **📥 Data export** – Export tasks as JSON for easy backup or analysis
- **🗑️ Storage management** – Quickly clear local storage for testing
- **💡 Development info** – Display the tech stack used in the project
```
```
